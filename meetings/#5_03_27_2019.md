[#1](#Topic-1) Discusssing implementation of heat efficient building    

### Topic-1  

#### Discussions  
- The Sensibo device, which is a smart home solution for controlling the Air-conditioner would not be a good solution 
for the average Nigerian, the main reason being the cost. The normal Airconditioner unit used by the average Nigerian is only 
a few dollars more expensive than the device,making it only suitable for the above average Nigerian. The desired solutio would be with the price point not more than about $10.
- Large scale / Industrially recycled materials does not seem to fit the use-case in theory, as the cost of production would exceed the price point 
of the average Nigerian, and unless we achieve a standard production, would not be attractive to the rich population, as a tandard would be expected.  
- On the other end, utilizing recycled items such as blankets, foams, cotton as is and only need to do a little treatment for 
disinfecting and fumigation, therby ensuring a low price point, looks attractive in theory.  
- For the Rich/ above average population, a industrally produce material would be a prefferable solution.
