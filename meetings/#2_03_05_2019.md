The perpetual energy concept is wildly dependednt on the perpetual motion concept.

#### Discussions
Possible implementaions and models for fixes  
  

- Effective Metering model
    - Pre-paid meters which are gradually being implemented in the country might be a step in the right direction, as it leads to conciousness about wasted energy
    - Timed devices/appliances, which work automatically turn on/off based on the time of the day. An example is an Air-conditioning sets which turn off 
    automatically at 9:00am, when it is expected no one is home, and turn on at 4:30pm, since people should return home by 5:00am
    - Tamper proof metering system, which ensures effective metering of consumed data. This has to preferrably be usable with the present technology

  #### Resolution  
  - Investigate tamper proof metering sytems (3 Days)
    - System, should be based on the existing technology
  
- Appliance level optimization
   - make Systems and Apliances energy efficient
   - ensure the energy efficiency optimization does not reduce performance

- Subsidising and making accessible cheaper appliances
   - Economies of buying defaulting Acs and giving new/refurbished ones at a subsidised rate
     - Has too much overhead, as the Nigerian system does not cater for recycling of resources
   
#### Notes
- The Nigerian generation has issues which require education to help make solving the country easy

### TODO
- Run experimenton collecting dead phones (for free), salvaging working parts and selling to repairers
