### Topic-2
#### Introduction into Power problems in the country  
##### Discussion
- Nigeria's power problem has been existing and widely known for years, and different solutions have since been proffered. The problem with said solutions is that they are more of temporary fixes (Inverters) and alternate power sources (generators).
- Intention here is to come up with an actual solution which have the following characteristics
  -  Should be neither a `temp fix` nor a ` fossil fuel subscription based alternate source` such as the generating sets which need fossil fuel to run.
  - Should be Non-governmental. (not requiring government participation)
  - Should be accessible to the average man
  - Could be a series of action/ scheme or product which fulfills all the other conditions. (Could be a combination of existing products or a new product or series of actions)
  - Should be a one-off expenditure if a product (No subscription)
##### Resolution  
- Accumulate materials/, resources, forums and other possible sources of viable information
- Meet on 03/05/2019, to aggregate the said resources
