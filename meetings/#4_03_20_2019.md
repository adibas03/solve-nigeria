### Topic-1  

#### Discussions  
- Choice of disbursement method for the guideline should be a combination of Images, 
videos and the article post, as they each have different roles and reach.  
There is hope that the materials seep into the P2P stream of data, to help greatly increase the reach.
   
   

### Topic-2

Roofing flow and materials

this was once the practise, although this is no loger in vogue.
