[#1](#Topic-1) Discussion on Power problems in the country  

### Topic-1  

#### Resources
- Roofing cooling solution: 

#### Discussions
- Efficiency of the appliances should be higher, with more power supply, so we gain some efficiency just by allowing constant power supply
  -  The efficiency gained is most likely negligible compared to the amount of efficiency needed to reduce total power consumption.
  
- The location or installation of appliances also affects the efficiency
  - The refridgerators are able to control the heat loss/gain to the environment, this would not work for Air conditioners for example 
  which have no control of the heat loss/gain in the cooled area
  - A guideline to efficinet building structure solves a big part of this issue.
    - A simple insulation solution for windows, doors and roofs during building process 
    - A low-cost solution for already existing buildings which would help achieve as much hat control as possible.  
    
- Heat gained by glass should be investigated, as there are high number of glass entrances or windows
  - Having a sheet of reflective material, sort of a sticker which must be reflective to the outside, and optionally
  transparent from the inside solves this greatly. 
  
#### Resolution  
- Research a guideline to achieve low cost efficinet heat loss/gain control for buildings, implement them, and write a post based on the implementation.  


#### TODO  
- Run low cost efficinet heat loss/gain control for buildings implementaion, and write a post based on the implementation.
This should be our first agenda, as it seems to be a low hanging fruit.
